## Context
<p align=justify>Rice has been one of the most widely consumed foods for a large part of human population. Numerous different rice varieties are imported and exported 
worldwide, making it the backbone of many countriesâ€™ economy. Rice seeds of different varieties can be accidentally or intentionally mixed during any of the steps in a 
rice production pipeline, introducing impurities. These impurities could damage the trust between rice importers and exporters, calling for the need to develop a reliable
rice variety inspection system.</p>
